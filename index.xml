      <title>How I keep a plaintext journal</title>

      <description>Keeping a journal has become a transformative experience for me. I tried to start writing out my thoughts multiple times last 5 years or so. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t click until my last attempt.
What helped me in the end was to concentrate on analyzing problems that really bother me and be curious and frank about it. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell you there was any particular tool or magical method that helped me to jumpstart it.</description>

      <title>Setting up postfix in OS X 10.14 (Mojave)</title>
      <link>https://knazarov.com/posts/setting_up_postfix_on_os_x/</link>

      <description>I wrote this post because there are lots of articles that describe how to set up postfix on OS X which recommend strange things, like disabling System Integrity Protection. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how it can be achieved easily without any ugly hacks.
Here&amp;rsquo;s why you may want to use postfix on OS X:
 if you are managing an OS X server (like in a build farm) and want to be able to send automated emails if you use mutt or other mailer like mu4e and want a persistent outgoing mail queue that works offline to write and debug scripts that use default system mailer  First thing you need to know about postfix in OS X is that it is already set up and running!</description>

      <title>Running Herokuish apps in Docker</title>
      <link>https://knazarov.com/posts/herokuish_apps_in_docker/</link>

      <description>Heroku allows you to build an app, push the code to a git repository and have it automatically deployed to a server. The beauty of this solution is that if you follow certain simple conventions, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to invest any brainpower into the deployment at all.
Then comes Dokku, which is built on the same principles as Heroku and can serve as a drop-in replacement for it on your own server.</description>

      <title>Exposing Docker containers to external network</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to assign a routable and externally visible IP address to your Docker containers, you probably know that it&amp;rsquo;s not a trivial task. There are a few posts out there that show a few interesting methods, like this or this or even from the creators of Docker itself.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging for a better method, that will still allow you to use Docker API and don&amp;rsquo;t executeÂ any host-side commands after starting every container.</description>

      <description>Simple Applicant Tracking System http://hiring.knazarov.com is a simple Applicant Tracking System that helps make hiring in small teams easier. It has just a bare minimum of functionality: a table with all your candidates, ability to upload CVs and comment on individual candidates. It also allows a team of people to join together into an organization and collaborate on the shared pool of candidaets.
I&amp;rsquo;ve developed it mostly for my own purposes while working at Tarantool.</description>
