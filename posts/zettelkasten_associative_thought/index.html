    <p>Zettelkasten is a knowledge management system invented by Niklas
Luhmann, a German sociologist.</p>
<p>It is based on an idea that when you need to produce meaningful work,
it is likely too late to start collecting input. Say, writing an
article or an assignment. If you start with an idea and then try to
work through sources of information as your idea develops, you put
yourself under stress: it is very hard to think one step at a time in
an area where you don&rsquo;t have expertise.</p>
<p>So there are 2 problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procrastination and loss of interest</li>
<li>Forming negative association with writing</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, what Luhmann proposed was the idea that when you start
writing, the process should be mostly editorial: there shouldn&rsquo;t be
any active thinking or invention. You should just go over ideas,
references and connections you&rsquo;ve build up over time and combine them
into a linear text.</p>
<p>In addition to that, he noted that the only viable way to actually
collect ideas is to do your work and reading under assumption that you
will write about it in the end. And the process of writing will then
improve connections between subjects in your brain and will help you
think better and will open up a way to more advanced topics.</p>
<p>In order to start, you need a place where you will capture raw
ideas/notes, and another place where you will put ideas for permanent
storage. The first one can be really anything - a pen and paper
notebook will do fine, as well as digital alternatives like Evernote,
OneNote or Apple Notes. The most important thing here is to not
overthink the structure - just capture things as you read. The second
one should be able to support links between notes, have tags and
full-text search. One good example of this is <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> (if
you are on a Mac).</p>
<p>When you read something, take very brief notes of core ideas (just a
few sentences in your own words), include references to original
article/book and store it into your first system.</p>
<p>Once in a while, take your time to transfer notes from your first
system to the second one. Here, take time to think about what context
you may use information in. Don&rsquo;t try to make any categories for your
information &ndash; this will put unnecessary strain on your brain, produce
unneeded clutter and in general won&rsquo;t help (you won&rsquo;t come up with a
good taxonomy anyway). Instead, use tags such as #job, or
#graduatework or things like that. Then you will be able to find your
notes later with regular text search (which computers are really good
at).</p>
<p>If you have an idea, do a text search on your second system to pull
all relevant knowledge about it. Use those references and recorded
thoughts to feed the new idea and develop it a few steps further.
Make a new note that contains the idea and link back to original notes
that you used to develop it. Rinse and repeat with more high-level
ideas.</p>
<p>Above all, don&rsquo;t try to build any excessive structure in your
knowledge base: it can kill your motivation. Computers are so powerful
that they can find information in your notes instantly even if you
produce dozens of pages a day, every day of your life. Think about it
as an extension of your brain: it doesn&rsquo;t store information
hierarchically, but associatively. This way they will hopefully be
able to work together.</p>
